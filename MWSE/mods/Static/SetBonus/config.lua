-- config.lua: Configuration data for the Set Bonus mod.
-- It provides two tables:
-- `sets`: where registered sets' data is stored, with set names as keys and the corresponding set data as values.
-- `setLinks`: a lookup table where item IDs are used as keys and the corresponding set data as values.
